/*
  # Complete Roundtable Meeting Agent Schema
  
  This migration creates all necessary tables for the roundtable meeting system:
  1. Agent definitions and personas (stored securely on backend)
  2. User sessions and meeting data
  3. Meeting responses and transcripts
  4. Final summaries and reports
  
  ## Security
  - All agent personas are stored server-side only
  - RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
  - API keys are never exposed to frontend
  
  ## Tables Created
  - agents: Agent definitions and personas
  - roundtable_sessions: User sessions and meeting plans
  - roundtable_meetings: Individual meetings within sessions
  - roundtable_responses: Agent responses for each round
  - users: User profiles and preferences
